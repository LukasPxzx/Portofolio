# My Portfolio

## About 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my personal and academic projects on Deep Learning and Machine Learning and their applications to the real world. This portfolio's objective is to share my work, demonstrate my skills, and provide a view onto my journey in AI research and application.

## What You Will Find Here

In this portfolio, you will find:

- **Personal Projects**: A variety of AI applications that I have developed independently, showcasing different aspects of machine learning and deep learning.

- **Academic Projects**: Assignments and projects from my coursework that highlight the concepts, techniques, and tools I've learned in AI.

- **Application Types**: 
  - Some projects are simple applications that can be run on any standard computer.
  - Others may require specific hardware (like RaspberryPi 2W, sensors, etc...) or software setups (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) to function properly.

## Technologies Used

Throughout my projects, I have worked with various programming languages and technologies, including but not limited to:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- JavaScript
- TensorFlow.js
- Teachable Machine
- CSS.js
- SQLite3
- Hashlib
